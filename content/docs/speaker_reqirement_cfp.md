# Forge Utah Foundations Speaker Guide

So you have found yourself speaking at an upcoming Forge Utah Event. Congratulations!

We organizers and board members are anxiously awaiting to hear and learn from you. While you are preparing your talk keep the following requirements and suggestions in mind.

## Talk Requirements

Talks are to be of the Tutorial style. That means they should be between 45 min - 1 hour in length including questions. They should not exceed an hour to respect the time of participants who have long distances to travel home. If your material will be longer than an hour in length contact your meetup organizer so they can adjust the start and end times of the meetup. 

Talks are expected to have appropriate depth and breadth for the respective audience. This means you should tell a story with your talk, Explain the problem, what challenges it poses and how your technology helps solve them. Context, explanations and examples should be included in your talk.
