The Forge Utah Foundation and its meetup communities are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for participants at all of our events. Forge Utah Foundation events are intended for professional networking and collaboration within the Utah technical community. They exist to encourage the open exchange of ideas and expression and require an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group. While at Forge Utah Foundation events or related ancillary or social events, any participants, including members, speakers, attendees, volunteers, sponsors, exhibitors, booth staff and anyone else, should not engage in harassment in any form.
